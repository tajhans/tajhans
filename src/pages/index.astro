		Hi, I’m a high school student passionate about full-stack web development.<br />
		Over the years, I’ve built a variety of projects, from websites for my robotics team to an online poker platform that keeps my friends connected even when we’re apart.<br />
		Recently, I’ve been diving into the world of machine learning. My current project is a neural network-powered chess engine, combining two of my biggest interests: coding and chess.<br />
		I love taking on new challenges and solving real-world problems with code.

Hi, I’m a high school student passionate about full-stack web development.
Over the years, I’ve built a variety of projects, from websites for my robotics team to an online poker platform that keeps my friends connected even when we’re apart.
Recently, I’ve been diving into the world of machine learning. My current project is a neural network-powered chess engine, combining two of my biggest interests: coding and chess.
I love taking on new challenges and solving real-world problems with code.
